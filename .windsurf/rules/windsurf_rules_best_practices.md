# ü™Å Windsurf Rules & Workflows ‚Äì Best Practices

## Rule Design Principles

- **Atomic Scope**: Each rule should have a single, clear purpose. One purpose per rule file.
- **Concrete Examples**: Provide specific examples and code snippets rather than abstract descriptions.
- **Clear Description**: Include a short front-matter description explaining the purpose and intent of each rule.
- Include the "trigger" section, and always default to "trigger: manual" at the top of every Windsurf rule. Example Header
  ```yaml
  ---
  trigger: manual
  ---

  ```
- Available rule trigger options:
  - manual
  - always_on
  - model_decision
  - glob

## Rule Structure

- **Front Matter**: Every rule file should begin with YAML front matter containing metadata:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Rule Title
  description: Brief description of rule purpose
  author: Untamed Theory
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  version: 1.0
  ---
  ```
- The author in the rule metadata should always be "Untamed Theory" for rules generated using this prompt. 
- **File Organization**: Keep a consistent directory structure. Though normally we'd store windsurf rules in the `.windsurf` directory, because this is meant to be shared we will store the windsurf rules in a file called `windsurf` (not hidden):
  ```
  windsurf/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vibesec-general/      # General security rules
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vibesec-code/         # Code security rules
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vibesec-framework/    # Framework security rules
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vibesec-ai/           # AI security rules
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vibesec-supplychain/  # Supply chain security rules
  ```

## Workflow Best Practices

- **Conciseness**: Keep workflows clear and focused (‚â§ 7 steps per workflow).
- **Step Titles**: Use descriptive `title:` fields on each step for clarity.
- **Early Inputs**: Prompt for required inputs early in the workflow.
- **Automation Mindset**: Design workflows as AI-enhanced CI jobs, automating repeatable processes.
- **Source Control**: Store workflows in `.windsurf/workflows/` and track them via source control.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Documentation**: Include comments explaining complex logic or non-obvious decisions.
